Quickly check if javascript is enabled or disabled in your browser.

The site was tested using FF extension I wrote called [Script Switch](https://github.com/JordanMajd/script_switch), however the most reliable way to disable your Javascript is in your browser settings:

- Firefox: open up `about:config` and search for `javascript.enabled` and set it to `false`.
- Chrome:  navigate to `chrome://settings/content/javascript` and set the `Blocked` switch to off.
