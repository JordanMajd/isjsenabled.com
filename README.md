[isjsenabled.com](http://isjsenabled.com) is website to test if javascript is enabled or disabled in a browser.

The tool was original built to validate an FF extension I wrote, [Script Switch](https://github.com/JordanMajd/script_switch).

However, the simplest way to disable Javascript is through the browser settings:

- Firefox: navigate to `about:config` and search for `javascript.enabled` and set it to `false`.
- Chrome: navigate to `chrome://settings/content/javascript` and set the `Blocked` switch to off.
- Safari: press `âŒ˜ + ,` select the `Security` tab and uncheck `Enable Javascript`.
- IE11: select the gear icon, `internet options`, select the `Security` tab, and for each zone (`Internet`, `Local intranet`, `Truested sites`, `Restricted sites`) click on `Custom Level`, find `Active Scripting`.
- Edge: does not allow you to disable javascript.
