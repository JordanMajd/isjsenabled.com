[isjsenabled.com](http://isjsenabled.com) is website to test if javascript is enabled or disabled in a browser.

The tool was original built to validate an FF extension I wrote, [Script Switch](https://github.com/JordanMajd/script_switch).

However, the simplest way to disable Javascript is through the browser settings:

- Firefox: open up `about:config` and search for `javascript.enabled` and set it to `false`.
- Chrome:  navigate to `chrome://settings/content/javascript` and set the `Blocked` switch to off.
